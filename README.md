# Datadog Take Home Assignment

This project creates a static single-page site based on [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/vl7QxNnNIGIebkJCD1qv5T/datadog-websites-team-homepage-redesign).

The following technologies are used:
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [Glide.js](https://glidejs.com/)

You can see the site in action on [this Netlify page](https://lorimccaskill-datadog-take-home.netlify.app/).

For further details on my decision-making and troubleshooting hurdles I came across, please see more info in the [documentation](documentation) directory of this repo.

Thanks for taking a look! --Lori
